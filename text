Topics to Cover in Demo
🔹 Short Topic Explanation
Introduce the project domain (e.g., Art Gallery or Recipe Management).
Explain the need for structured data storage, relationships, and automation.
🔹 ER Diagram Showcase
Display the ER diagram.
Highlight how entities like Painting, Author, Transaction, or Recipe, Ingredient, Step are connected.
🔹 How to Identify in Your Project
Mapping Tables: Used for many-to-many relationships (e.g., Painting_Style, Recipe_Ingredient).
Transaction Tables: Capture dynamic events (e.g., Transactions, Recipe_Reviews).
🔹 Stored Procedures
Encapsulate logic like updating painting status or recipe ratings.
Improve maintainability and reusability.
🔹 Normal CRUD Operations
Basic INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE queries for each table.
Foundation for interacting with the database.
🔹 Functions
Reusable logic blocks used in triggers or queries.
Example: ValidatePaintingAvailability() or CalculateRecipeCalories().
🔹 Triggers
Automate actions like updating status or preventing invalid inserts.
Example: Auto-update painting status after a sale.
🔹 Materialized Views
Precomputed views for reporting (e.g., daily painting status, top-rated recipes).
Improve performance for complex queries.
🔹 Indexes
Speed up queries on frequently filtered or joined columns.
Example: Index on status_updated_at or recipe_category.
🚀 If You Want a Scalable DB (Slide: “Scalability Techniques”)
Sharding: Distribute data across multiple servers to handle large volumes.
Micro-Databases: Use separate databases for different services/modules.
Snowflake Schema: Normalize dimension tables for analytical flexibility.
UUIDs: Use universally unique identifiers for better indexing and distributed consistency.
